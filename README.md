# Huffman
This tool can compress and decompress plain text files by using the Huffman algorithm. This project was made to learn more about compression and performance. 

Use it like this to compress:
`python huffman.py test.txt`
And like this to decompress:
`python huffman.py -d test.bin`

This script was made for fun, all suggestions on boosting performance are more than welcome!
